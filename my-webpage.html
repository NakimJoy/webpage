    <h1>Paris</h1>
    <img src="eiffle tower.jpg" width="220">
    <p>
      Paris, the capital of France, is a city that captivates visitors with its rich history, culture, and
      charm. Paris is often called the City of Love. Its charming streets, cozy cafes, and great sights make it
      an ideal destination for couples. Whether you’re strolling along the Seine River or enjoying a candlelit
      dinner, romance is in the air. I'd like to wander the medieval streets of the Marais, relax on a Paris
      “beach,” explore the famous Les Puces flea market, or enjoy a concert in a magnificent Paris church. Of
      course also take a cooking class, immerse myself in digital art shows at Atelier des Lumieres, and marvel
      at cherry trees in bloom during spring.

    <h1>A Foreign language</h1>
    <p>Oddly, I find spanish to be quiet an intriguing language. Being able to travel knowing that you can get
      yourself around and handle pretty much any scenario is one of the biggest reasons to learn Spanish. One
      interesting fact about Spanish is 7.9% of internet users communicate in Spanish, making it the second most
      commonly used language on digital platforms. Only one Spanish-speaking country—Mexico—is among the 10
      countries with the greatest number of internet users.
      You can even travel alone, without having to rely on tour guides or other tourists. It takes away the
      stress and uncertainty that sometimes comes with travel. Spanish makes it feel like and everything is just
      so alright.</p>

  <h1> My Favourite Subjects</h2>
    <div class="subjects">
      <div class="subject eco">
        <h2><u>ECONOMICS</u></h2>
        <p>The first subject I enjoyed taking in my undergrad was economics. I've always loved to analyse data and bring
          meaning to graphs, this made me see the world around me in a unique way. The graph below shows a bit of what
          Economics covers, we deal a lot with graphs, interpretation and predictions of the economy using various
          source data. Economics examines different types of market structures, such as perfect competition, monopoly,
          monopolistic competition, and oligopoly. Each structure has its own characteristics and implications for
          resource allocation and efficiency.</p>

      <div class="subject claw">
        <h2><u>COMMERCIAL LAW</u></h2>
        <p>Secondly, I'd say Commercial law took most of my study breaks. It was just understandable, although i think
          the
          lecturer just made it so enjoyable, I really enjoyed learning the legal side of things- I never saw the need,
          but this subject made me thing of starting my own business with so much confidence. Besides the fact that my
          lecture just made the subject so understandable and easy to pass, like below, commercial law coverd a lot of
          real
          life legal matters in all aspects and i love justice, almost thought of changing my degree to Law for a sec.

      </div>
      <div class="subject cba">
        <h2><u>COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS (CBA)</u></h2>
        <p>Lastly, my favourite subject would have to be cost-benefit analysis, although i did this one later on, it
          brought
          back a lot of hope into data analytics when the dream seemed to become bluring because course wasn't getting
          easier. This one really was so eye opener, as an aspiring economists i know i will deal a lot with analysis,
          balancing budgets nad making crutial decisions that will benefit the economy with less costs or more
          effiecient
          spending, so like the graph below CBA was just taking me to that era.</p>

          <p>The house is a single-story red-brick matchbox built in 1945. It has bullet holes in the walls and the
            facade has scorch marks from attacks with Molotov cocktails. The house was petrol bombed several times and
            often raided by members of the police force during the apartheid. Next to the house lies the Morris Isaacson
            High School where the June 1976 uprisings began. The house was commissioned as part of a Johannesburg City
            tender for new houses in Orlando.</p>
